# Software-Security

In this assignment we worked as a developer for a software company called Global Rain. We were tasked with working with a client called Artemis Financial which develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. We were first asked to determine an appropriate algorithm cipher that fit the needs of the client. We then gave details about the selected cipher and discussed how it will benefit the software. We then generated certificates and deployed the cipher into the code to secure the software. We then ran dependency checks to see the vulnerabilities and suppressed any false positives.

I think I did well on identifying the vulnerabilities through the dependency report and then going back into the code and suppressing the false positives. All the layers of security added helped to make it so someone could not gain unauthorize access to the software. This helps to keep the clients mind at ease knowing that their software is safe, and their customer do not need to worry about their information getting stolen. 

I did have some challenges with running a checksum report on the software. I was able to code in the checksum into the software and then I could not get it to run on a browser, but it did work on the command prompt when I tried that. I want to do more research on this and practice more with different security measures with software. 

In looking over the Vulnerability Assessment Process diagram, I was able to see potential risks in the code and how we could add certain things to help make it more secure.
When working with code I tried to do a lot of tests as I could along the way to make sure I did not have to come back after I was done to find the errors. This is something that I am doing better with, and it helps with not having to do as much debugging. 

From this assignment I would show how I was able to run a dependency check on a software and be able to identify the vulnerabilities and be ablet to suppress false positives. I would also show how I was able to deploy an algorithm cipher for encryption within the software.
